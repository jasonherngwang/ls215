Problem
------------------------------------------
Sentiment Analysis uses lists of positive and negative words to determine if
the mood of some text is positive, negative, or neutral.

Sentiment score = # positive words - # negative words
- Positive number: positive sentiment
- 0: neutral
- Negative number: negative sentiment

Inputs:
- Some text
- Array of positive words
- Array of negative words
Outputs: 
- List and count of positive words
- List and count of negative words
- Sentiment: pos, neg, neutral

Rules/Requirements
- In the console output, words used multiple times are included.
- Words appear in the console output in the order they appear in the text.
- The word must stand alone. Adjacent punctutation and whitespace are allowed,
  but adjacent letters are not.
  - E.g. For the positive word 'noble', the text 'nobler' would NOT count as 
    a match. The text ' noble,' would count.

Examples, Test Cases
------------------------------------------


Data Structure, Algorithm
------------------------------------------
There are:
- P positive words in the array
- N negative words
- M words in the input string

Algorithm 1 - DOESN'T WORK since we need to list duplicates in order
instead of search for all instance at once.
- Iterate over the array of positive words
  - For each word, search the input string for all instances of the word
    - Can use match with global regex
  - Add the total number of positive words to a total
- Repeat for negative words
- Calculate the difference

Algorithm 2
- Split the input string into an array of words, using whitespace and 
  punctuation as the separator.
- Iterate over words in the array.
  - If current word is in the positive words array
    - Add 1 to the positive words total
    - Add the word to the array of positive words seen
  - Repeat with negative words
- Calculate the difference
